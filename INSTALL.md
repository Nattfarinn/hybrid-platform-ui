# Installation

## Current development version
Custom repositories and requirements must be set at root level during the current development phase.
For now, you should checkout the branch from [ezsystems/ezplatform#177](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/pull/177),
and run composer update afterwards.

Be careful, as this will checkout very early development branches of most packages.
